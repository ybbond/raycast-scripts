# My scripts for Raycast Script Extensions
Scripts for [Raycast](https://raycast.com/), it is a good [Spotlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)) and [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). There is [repository for community script](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands/tree/master/commands) already, but I just want to provide them here.

This is the specific scripts that I add or modify for myself. Most of them are `*.template.*` files. There will be short documentation inside the `*.template.*` files on how to make them fits your use cases.
